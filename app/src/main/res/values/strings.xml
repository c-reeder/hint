    <string name="overview_body">Hint is a fun and challenging game designed for 4 players (2 teams of 2). The object of the game is to manage to get your partner to guess an assigned word using only a single word Hint!   You may not converse with your partner about the word. You may only say your single word HINT. You can say it with special voice inflection if you want to, but that is all.  If your partner does not guess the word, then you pass the phone to the other person and they will have the chance to do the same thing, but for less points. This continues until either someone guesses the word or there are no more points to be won!  To make clear whose turn it is, each set of partners will have a Person A and Person B. Usually if possible, the two A\'s will sit together across from their B partners. Thus the phone will be passed back and forth between the 2 A\'s until one of them manages to get their B partner to guess the word. At that point, the phone is passed over to the B\'s who will now do the same with a new word.  There are 6 rounds in total in the game. Each round has two parts, in one part the A\'s will have a turn to give HINTS, then the B\'s.</string>
    <string name="strategy_title" >Strategy</string>
    <string name="strategy_body">"The idea is to be able to assess how many hints it will take to guess a particular word. If you give a great hint and your partner ALMOST guesses it....then you may have inadvertently setup the other team for victory! "</string>
    <string name="taking_turn_title">Taking your turn</string>
    <string name="taking_turn_body">Before a round may begin, the two opponents who are going to be giving the hints, must agree upon the word to be used. For example, let\'s say that the A\'s are giving the hints this round. Both of the A\'s will look at the phone and see if the word is guessable, if so, they will tap accept and the round begins. At that point, the first A will give a hint, and then the other A and so on. Note: You MAY skip a word if you and your opponent agree upon it, but beware that if you skip a word, you may not go back to it and furthermore you and your opponent have only 5 skips per game, so together you must spend them wisely! Don\'t skip a word just because it looks challenging! That\'s part of the fun!  In order to keep track of who\'s turn it is, look at the status bar at the bottom of the screen that tells you if the A\'s or the B\'s are giving HINTS, as well as which Team\'s A is currently giving the HINT.</string>
